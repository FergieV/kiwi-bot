# kiwi-bot
 
This is a super simple Furcadia bot skeleton written in Python. The account/character deets are stored in the `bot.conf` file and you just run `kiwibot.py`. It accepts chat-relayed command issued via whisper from the "owner" specified in the configuration. It does log pretty cleanly to text files in the `logs` folder, but don't expect anything robust in that regard.
